> 🦁 Miss your leny? Need tech help? Just ask!

* * *

`ask.leny.me` is the future of tech help, a *LAAS*, *Leny As A Service*. It's an inside joke with my learners at BeCode, wanted to be able to reach me for help after their scholarship with me. They imagined a platform where they can ask me for help, and here we are, designing a small platform to do so.

> ☝️ **NOTE:** this project is a *side-project*/*kinda-joke* with my learners from [BeCode](https://becode.org).
